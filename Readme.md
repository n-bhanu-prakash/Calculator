**Calculator - A Friendly Minimalist Helper**
**The Idea**
In a world of complex calculators and bulky interfaces, the goal was to create a simple, intuitive calculator that feels as friendly as a conversation. With HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a touch of Bootstrap, this project delivers a straightforward yet powerful calculator that covers all the essentials with a user-friendly interface.

**The Story Behind It**
This calculator began as a journey to explore the fundamentals of web development, with a focus on clean and responsive design. The idea was to craft a tool that is both minimal and reliable, with a sleek appearance anyone can enjoy. It’s not just about the numbers—it's about making calculations accessible and pleasant.

**What It Does**

**How It Was Built**
Calci was crafted using:

HTML to structure the calculator interface.
CSS and Bootstrap for a clean, modern look with rounded buttons, subtle shadows, and responsive design.
JavaScript to power the calculations, supporting both mouse and keyboard interactions.
